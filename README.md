# Toward a Futuristic Emerald Isle

Welcome to the repository of **"Toward a Futuristic Emerald Isle"**, a 3D graphics project created as part of the Computer Graphics module (CSU44052). This project demonstrates the implementation of an infinite scene with various graphical features using OpenGL 3.3 and C/C++.

## Features

### Core Features
- **Geometry Rendering & Texture Mapping**: Includes a textured skybox and detailed low-poly models.
- **Lighting and Shadows**: 
  - **Phong Lighting** for realistic illumination.
  - Support for multiple light sources and their projected shadows.
  - Dynamic spotlights for added scene realism.
- **Screen-Space Ambient Occlusion (SSAO)**: Enhances the visual quality by simulating light occlusion in tightly packed areas, with its effect deliberately exaggerated for emphasis.
- **Animations**: Animated objects with detailed textures, such as an alien character.
- **Infinite Scene**: Seamless exploration with no visible boundaries.
- **Optimized Performance**: Designed to maintain a minimum framerate of 165 FPS on an NVIDIA 4060 GPU.
